# :star2: About Me:
My focus is in human genetics and proteomics research, machine learning, deep learning, data science, bioinformatics, software engineering. I have a demonstrated hands on experience in utilising biological datasets in statistical/ML/AI techniques do develop bioactives and biomarkers and take the research all the way to the commercialization. 

Currently, I work at [Wellcome Sanger Institute](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/person/ozols-matiss/) on petabytes of data gathered by single cell/bulk rnaseq, genomic and proteomic methods to build large scale analytics pipelines and provide insights in vascular diseases. Here I operate as a principal researcher, bioinformatician and software engineer supporting teams in Sanger Institute, Universities of Cambridge, Leicester and Manchester.

I have a background in medical engineering, bioinformatics, genomics, proteomics, dermatology. I have worked together with [Wallgreens Boots Alliance](https://www.no7beauty.co.uk/) throughout my PhD titled 'Bioinformatic identification of skin ageing biomarkers and putative matrikines' and Postdooc to derive and manifacture novel bioactives. This coloboration contributed significantly to commercial aspects and resulted in 5 international patents. 

I have expereince in developing large scale scientific web applications and databases, please have a look at our 4 disctinct web apps hosted under our Manchester Proteome:
1) Skin Proteome:https://www.manchesterproteome.manchester.ac.uk/#/Proteome
2) Protein Locational Fingerprinter: https://www.manchesterproteome.manchester.ac.uk/#/MPLF
3) Protein Susceptability Calculator: https://www.manchesterproteome.manchester.ac.uk/#/MPSC

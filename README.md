# 💫 About Me:
My focus is in human genetics and proteomics research, machine learning, deep learning, data science, bioinformatics, software engineering. I have a demonstrated hands on experience in utilising biological datasets in statistical/ML/AI techniques do develop bioactives and biomarkers and take the research all the way to the commercialization. Currently, I work at Wellcome Sanger Institute on petabytes of data gathered by single cell/bulk rnaseq, genomic and proteomic methods to provide insights in vascular diseases. Here I operate as a principal researcher, bioinformatician and software engineer supporting teams in Sanger Institute, Universities of Cambridge, Leicester and Manchester.

I have a background in medical engineering, bioinformatics, genomics, proteomics, dermatology. My PhD thesis was sponsored by Wallgreens Boots Alliance titled 'Bioinformatic identification of skin ageing biomarkers and putative matrikines' which has contributed significantly to commercial aspects and resulted in 5 international patents.
